# Instructors

- Please see our [instructor repository](https://github.com/fredhutchio/instructors) for general guidelines relevant to all classes. Additional recommendations specific for this course can be found below.
- You may choose to share your script to Dropbox to help folks stay on track. If you create the project in Dropbox, you can copy the link to each week's script and share in HackMD. Files ending in `.R` are rendered as text in a browser window, but learners will need to refresh the screen to see updates.
- Administering challenges: Typing the challenge exercise into the script as a comment is usually easiest. Some challenges that include a chunk of code may be added to the HackMD for learners to copy and paste (or it can be copied from Dropbox if you're sharing your script). 

## Class 1

- [Data Carpentry's Intro to R and RStudio](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html) has another series of instructions for overviewing RStudio
- Timing and pacing: A break generally works midway through the "Vectors" section.

## Class 2

- Timing and pacing: usually it takes 30 minutes to complete the section up through the first challenge exercise (importing tsv and txt). A break generally occurs when administering the challenges at the end of the section "Subsetting data frames".

## Class 3

- Timing and pacing: A break generally works when administering challenges at the end of "Selecting columns and rows".

## Class 4

- If you don't complete data filtering in Week 3, there are backup files in the GitHub repo that can be downloaded and imported
- Timing and pacing: A break generally works when administering challenges at the end of "Box and whisker plots".

## FAQs

- [use of = vs <- as assignment operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1741820/what-are-the-differences-between-and-in-r)
- other questions on code requirements vs. code conventions are usually explained in the [R style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
