**Resources for continued learning**
* Learn about other courses through fredhutch.io [here](http://www.fredhutch.io/resources/). Intermediate R courses include the following:
    * Intermediate R: Machine Learning (in development)
    * Intermediate R: Data Visualization (in development)
    * Intermediate R: Programming (based on [these lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) from Software Carpentry)
* The Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative, or Coop, hosts many community meetings and office hours about data science. Learn more information about these groups [here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/#community-groups) 
* Join the [Coop Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fhbig/shared_invite/enQtMzUyMDIxNzk3MDU3LWE5NGUyMTY1NGU0N2VmMmEyNTM5YzM1MmNlMTk2YmM1OWNkMmJiNTQxMTQ4OTNkMTFjMjk3M2Q0MzkwYzQ3NDA) to talk about data science with other Hutch researchers! 
* The [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org) is written by Hutch researchers and staff, and is a great place to find information about data management, bioinformatics, computing, and more.
